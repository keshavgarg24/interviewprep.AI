                <li><strong>Data Flow:</strong> The flow of data starts from the generation of Q/A pairs by the AI, moving through the display and recording of user's answers, converting speech to text, evaluating the answers, and finally storing everything in a database.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> User answers are not only evaluated but also given feedback, which implies a mechanism for continuous learning or user improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Storage:</strong> Storing data in the database indicates that the system is designed to keep a record of interactions, potentially for performance tracking or further analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Processing:</strong> The entire process from question generation to feedback is automated, showcasing an integrated AI-driven workflow.</li>

              <li><strong>Queryless DB:</strong> The label "Queryless DB" suggests that the interaction between the application and the database is abstracted through the ORM, reducing the need for explicit SQL queries in the application code.</li>
              <li><strong>ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):</strong> Drizzle ORM is responsible for managing database operations, making it easier to handle database interactions in a more object-oriented way.</li>
              <li><strong>Data Flow:</strong> The data flow involves the application sending data operations to Drizzle ORM, which then interacts with the PostgreSQL database, and the responses flow back through the ORM to the application.</li>
              <li><strong>Efficiency and Abstraction:</strong> Using an ORM like Drizzle can enhance efficiency and maintainability by abstracting the complexities of direct database interactions and allowing developers to work with more intuitive data models.</li>
